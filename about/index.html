            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>I am a high school senior who enjoys anything and everything STEM - from space and astronomy to computer programming. I am also a runner, baseball player, and I listen to a lot of music (mostly <a href = "http://muse.mu" target="_blank">Muse</a>).
            <p>My largest project to date is a word game called <a href="{{ site.fives }}" target="_blank">Fives</a>. Fives consists of over 1,200 lines of JavaScript and jQuery and is still in active development. Check it out!</p>
            <p>I am a two time All-State and First Team All-Conference cross country runner and I was the right fielder on the 2014 Class S State Championship baseball team. My best 5K time is 16:53.7 and my best mile time is 4:47.</p>
            <p>I founded a <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/ftc/" target="_blank">FIRST Tech Challenge</a> robotics team, the <a href="{{ site.cybernetics }}" target="_blank">Portland "Cybernetics"</a> in my Junior year, and during our first season of competition, we made it to the final match of the State Championship tournament (<a href="{% post_url 2015-03-08-cybernetics-state-championship %}" target="_blank">more</a>).</p>
            <p>My favorite gadget is my <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> that I use to host a local webserver for development and manage my Github repos.</p>
            <p>My favorite websites include <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/" target="_blank">Universe Today</a>, <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov" target="_blank">Astronomy Picture of the Day</a>, <a href="http://phys.org/" target="_blank">Phys.org</a>, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/" target="_blank">PCWorld</a>, and the two whose flairs are shown below.</p>
