            <p>I am a high school senior who enjoys anything and everything STEM - from space and astronomy to computer programming. I am also a runner, baseball player, and listen to a lot of music (mostly <a href = "http://muse.mu" target="_blank">Muse</a>).
            <p>My largest project to date is a word game called <a href="{{ site.fives }}" target="_blank">Fives</a>. Fives consists of over 1,200 lines of JavaScript and jQuery and is still in active development. Check it out!</p>
            <p>My favorite gadgets are my <a href = "http://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> and my iPhone.</p>
            <p>My favorite websites include <a href = "http://www.universetoday.com/" target="_blank">Universe Today</a>, <a href = "http://apod.nasa.gov" target="_blank">Astronomy Picture of the Day</a>, <a href = "http://phys.org/" target="_blank">Phys.org</a>, <a href = "http://mashable.com/" target="_blank">Mashable</a>, <a href = "http://www.theverge.com/" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, and <a href = "http://www.pcworld.com/" target="_blank">PCWorld</a>.</p>
