Having recently entered the post-graduation real world, I am admittedly susceptible to "life hacks" and "tips for succeeding at work" and other similar self-help propaganda. However, here I'm going to try to boost the signal above the noise and highlight a couple of the ideas that have stuck out to me the most in regards to *taking meaningful notes*.

A few months ago, a stumbled upon a [hacker news thread about note taking](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17278614), and then [some more](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18449961), [and even more since then](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21419478). I contemplated using some of the suggestions, such as the "Rocketbook Smart Reusable Notebook" and emacs org-mode. But, I decided to keep it simple with pen and paper because [**the simplest solution is almost always the best**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor). Handwritten notes are more concise because they are not verbatim recordings of information - handwriting simply isn't fast enough for taking notes verbatim. Taking advantage of this fact is the [Cornell note taking method](http://lsc.cornell.edu/notes.html), and a variation eloquently described by [Jim Kwik](https://youtu.be/3SkEUsk6Dxc?t=372).

Draw a line down the center of the page to create separate spaces for capturing and creating.

| Capturing | Creating |
|:---:|:---:|
| taking notes | making notes |
| facts | draw conclusions |
| figures | ask questions |

The focus here is to remain succinct on the left, and open minded on the right. Kwik poses 3 questions to guide the creation side
1. How can I use this and what is the benefit?
2. Why must I use this? Reasons reap results so [start with why](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en)
3. When can I use this?

Using these ideas as a guideline, my note taking has become more action-oriented, something I find myself *far* more likely to come back to in the future.
