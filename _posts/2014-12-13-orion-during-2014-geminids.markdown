During my first year observing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminids" target="_blank">Geminid Meteor Shower</a>, I decided to snap a few pictures with just my <a href="{% post_url 2015-01-13-iphone-tripod-gear %}">iPhone attached to a tripod with a shoelace</a>....more... Through the {{ site.slowcam }}, I was able to capture what I feel to be a solid picture, for an iPhone.

"Orion's Belt" - the widely known triplet of stars - are Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka.

In the drawn-in box below Orion's Belt are three more stars that illuminate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula" target="_blank">Orion Nebula (M42)</a>, one of the rare deep space objects that is actually visible with the naked eye in darker locations! Although it is just a haze to the eye, it's definitely worth a look.

I did some basic post processing work on the above image using GIMP. I took a dark frame, which is essentially a picture taken with the lens covered so that the hot pixels (pixels that no longer react to light and appear to always be on) can be subtracted from the final image.

In GIMP, I used the subtraction layer progress to minimize the hot pixels shown by the dark frame in the original image. I repeated this process with a few different dark frames and I saved the result after each iteration to GIF-ifiy it.
