During my first year observing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminids" target="_blank">Geminid Meteor Shower</a>, I decided to snap a few pictures with just my <a href="{{ post_url 2015-01-13-iphone-tripod }}">iPhone attached to a tripod with a shoelace</a>....more... Through the {{ site.slowcam }}, I was able to capture what I feel to be a solid picture, for an iPhone.

"Orion's Belt" - the widely known triplet of stars - are Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka.

In the drawn-in box below Orion's Belt are three more stars that illuminate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula" target="_blank">Orion Nebula (M42)</a>, one of the rare deep space objects that is actually visible with the naked eye in darker locations! Although it is just a haze to the eye, it's definitely worth a look.

Work in progress...
