The path to the State Championship for the <a href = "http://portlandcybernetics.github.io" target = "_blank">Portland Cybernetics</a> was not an easy one.

In CT, there are two qualifying tournaments through which a total of 24 teams secure a spot in the final State Championship tournament. The Cybernetics participated in both the qualifiers with varying levels of success.

In the first qualifier, which was the team's first ever competition, we placed an amazing 10th out of 29 teams. However, that performance was not good enough to secure us a spot in the championship because the teams are not selected purely based on competition performance.

In the second qualifier, while performing worse on the leaderboard, we were able to secure a spot - the first year team was moving on to the next competition!

In each tournament, the procedure is more or less the same. In a simplified overview:

* Each team competes in 5 matches that determine the leaderboard for the day.
* The top 4 teams on the leaderboard then select 2 other teams to join them and form an alliance. There are now 4 alliances, each with 3 teams.
* In best of 3 elimination style, the 4th ranked alliance competes against the 1st and the 3rd seed squares off against the 2nd seed.
* The winner of the 1 vs. 4 plays the winner of the 2 vs. 3 in another best of 3 matches.

And that is where the Cybernetics ended up at the end of our rookie year - in the final Championship match! Through an amazing morning of competition during which our robot scored increasingly more points each competition, we finished 8th out of the 24 teams. It came down to the wire when we were the **last** team to be chosen for an alliance.

We competed in the first match again the 1st seeded alliance and won by a solid margin. Due to some strategic planning, we sat out the next match as our other alliance partner stepped in. Unfortunately, we lost that match due to penalty points, but we still had the rubber match to go!

The Cybernetics went back into the field for the 3rd and final match of the first round, and we made the best of it. We beat the 1st seed alliance by an even greater margin than the first match, and we were headed to the championship match!

Our run ended there as the Cinderella team was no match for the other alliance - they were built around team that had already qualified for regional competition through another state's championship tournament (and qualified 2 more times through this competition, if that was allowed...).

However, as a member of the "Finalist Alliance," the team earned a trophy and all the team members got some awesome medals!
