The analytical data I've obtained from <a href="{{ site.fives }}" title="Fives Word Game" target="_blank">Fives Word Game</a> so far, with a focus on January and February of 2015....more...

<hr>

I started collecting data on the page views of Fives on May 27th, 2014 and I started tracking plays on June 30th, 2014. 
**Between those dates and the end of 2014:**
* 2,196 page views
* 767 plays from 218 unique players
* ~50% of plays were practice mode, ~34% classic, ~8% multiplayer and time trial each
* ~75% of traffic was from a desktop computer, ~20% of traffic was from a mobile device, and ~4% of traffic was from a tablet
* Chrome was responsible for ~75% of the traffic, Safari ~10% (including in-app browsers on mobile), IE ~9%, and Firefox ~3.5%
* 98% of traffic originated from the United States, 5 other countries were represented


In 2015, I added the ability to track games more in-depth, with data on words guessed and number of guesses per game.
**In January and February of 2015:**
* 764 page views
* 430 plays from 70 unique players
* ~81% of plays were practice mode, 10% classic, ~4% multiplayer and time trial each
* The overall win:loss ratio is about 3:1, about 4:1 for practice
* The most popular words to guess are "phial" (16), "after" (14), "clean" (14), "leads" (10), and "quiet" (10)
* ~86% of traffic was from a desktop computer, ~13% mobile, and ~1% tablet.
* Chrome was responsible for ~86% of the traffic, Safari ~11% (including in-app browsers on mobile), IE ~2%, and Firefox ~1%
* ~99% of the traffic originated from the United States, and ~1% from Canada

Stay tuned for the next report sometime at or before the 1 year anniversary of tracking code (May 27th).
