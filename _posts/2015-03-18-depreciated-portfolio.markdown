I learned how to on design for mobile browsers, optimize page load times by combining image resources, and use CSS3 animations - all skills that proved to be necessary for <a href = "{{ site.fives}} target="_blank">Fives</a>.

To preserve its memory, here is an screenshot of how it appeared right before I made the switch (relatively boring to look at, but there were animations on the bubbles and the image scrolled down on mouse-over):
