Side projects have always been a way I choose to spend a lot of my free time. Most of them never see the light of day, but recently I've had a few ideas that may escape on to my public Github. It's been a while...

[Fives](https://github.com/jondolan/fives) is a [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) rip-off for five letter words, a true test of vocabulary and a prime example of how to avoid the concept of [*cascading* in CSS](https://github.com/jondolan/fives/blob/gh-pages/styles/style.css)...made back in the day that jQuery was still something to add to your project, not something to remove.

My collegiate career directed my projects to be centered around my extra-curricular involvements in [IEEE robotics competitions](https://github.com/jondolan/arduino-pid), [teaching basic PID control](https://github.com/jondolan/tutorials/blob/master/controls/PWMthroughPID/FromPWMtoPID.md), [class projects](https://github.com/jondolan/auto-a-sketch), hackathons, and even on [lecturing about astrophotography](https://github.com/jondolan/tutorials/tree/master/astrophotography).

It also led to self-centered web design that focused more on being a resume and less on being useful. I no longer need a resume, so why not try to be useful?

I stumbled upon [you should write blogs](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs) the other day, and it resonated with me. I've been taking more notes to help organize my creativity, so a blog seems like a natural extension of that habit. I hope to spend time concentrating thoughts to create posts that serve as thorough explanations of a project, process, idea, or whatever I choose to focus on.

I've always enjoyed explaining things, decomposing hard concepts into simple language, because **to teach is to learn twice**. But I argue to teach is to learn **three** times - once from the hard work to develop understanding, once from the reorganization of thoughts required to verbalize that understanding, and a third time from the questions students ask. It's a positive feedback loop like none other - learners ask questions which guide teachers towards a better explanations.

With clear motivation ([start from why](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en)), it was now time to tackle the technical side. I read a [Hacker News article](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21840140) that led down a research rabbit hole to find examples of "dead simple" websites - I landed at [Dan Luu's blog](https://danluu.com/web-bloat/) and the [solar powered website](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website/). It became clear that I was going to create my own dead simple blog; a blog with minimal distraction, a simple and responsive design, and a focus on accessibility; a blog where the content does the talking, but the design gets the job done; ultimately, a blog that I don't have to worry about maintaining code for, only adding content to.

> The simplest solution is almost always the best

So I built a blog from a [single template](https://github.com/jondolan/jondolan.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/default.html) of **pure, vanilla HTML/CSS**. In harmony with "designing a website to last", I am not minimizing my HTML because like Jeff Huang, I too can trace my computer science roots back to *right click->view source*. I'm writing [posts](https://github.com/jondolan/jondolan.github.io/blob/master/_posts_/2019-12-21-Motivation.md) in Markdown - a portable, straightforward ASCII based format without an expiration date or vendor lock-in. I'm giving consideration to page weight (benchmarks to come) and avoiding bloat by writing from scratch. And it only took me one evening to do it.

So, here we go.
