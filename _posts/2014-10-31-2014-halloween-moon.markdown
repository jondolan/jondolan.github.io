My first go at astrophotography had to be the moon, right?...more...


This was taken through my {{ site.ds2114s }} with an iPhone 5 manually held up to my eyepiece.

I used the {{ site.procam }} to take the pictures - the default camera application is not able to focus on the moon very well. I auto-focused on the middle, so the focus is a little off in the brighter parts. Then again, it is a smartphone camera so I didn't expect DSLR quality.

I used a 9mm eyepiece which yields about a 110x magnification on my 1000mm focal length scope.

Overall, I was pretty happy with the results since it was my first try! Stay tuned for improved moon pictures (I hope).
