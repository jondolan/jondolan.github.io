This rig features an 8x42 pair of binoculars, a Nikon Coolpix S6000, a tripod, and a shoelace and CD for stability. The CD extends the platform of the tripod enough for the camera and the shoelace that wraps around the top of the binoculars keeps it secure. I also have a slightly different iteration of this mount that uses my telescope tripod with a wide, circular base instead of a tripod and a CD.
