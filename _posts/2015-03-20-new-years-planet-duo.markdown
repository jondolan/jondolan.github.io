This is my favorite astrophoto (that I've taken) so far. The planets are fascinating to observe - even with a simple pair of <a href="{% post_url 2015-03-19-camera-binocular-mount %}">binoculars</a> you can make out Jupiter's moons!

Mercury is hard to see without looking at the full resolution image. It is near the tree in the lower right corner in both images. Venus is much brighter than Mercury, and since Mercury is closer to the horizon, it has extra light around it to begin with. At this time of year, Mercury was just becoming visible in the dusk sky, so the window of opportunity for pictures was very small.

On Twitter, I shared this picture with well known astronomer <a href="https://twitter.com/BadAstronomer" target="_blank">Phil Plait</a>, author of the <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy.html" target="_blank">Bad Astronomy</a> blog. Much to my surprise, he shared it with all of his followers!
