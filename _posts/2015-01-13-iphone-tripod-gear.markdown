I know you're dying to see what this could possbily look like, so I'll start off with that...

Well, that's really all there is to it - the shoelace adds stability to the Velcro connection, the headphones are used to reduce vibration by not having to click the screen (also useful for cold nights), and the sandbag is in the old shoe to keep the tripod anchored when it's tilted back.
