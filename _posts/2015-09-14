There is a reason I was gone all this time...my Rasperry Pi's SD card became corrupt...and I had to redo my setup (but I have a nightly backup script, so I didn't lose any data!).

This took a while, and I had a very busy summer, but I'm almost back to where I need to be to write blog posts and start new projects!

Here is a picture of my favorite tool, tmux. I have written an automation script to create panes and windows to match my workflow. The best part is I can SSH in from multiple hosts and have everything synced (it's like TeamViewer for Windows but command line only).

In the mean time, I've started my academic career at the <a href = "http://www.gatech.edu">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> which has been an amazing experience so far.

I've joined the RoboJackets robotics team, IEEE professional engineering society for electiral and electronics engineers, and am on running club and the intramural ultimate frisbee team.

I'll keep this site updated with projects I start here at Tech!
